# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION

Heart disease is expanding step by step because of different factors like proficient or individual propensities, changing lifestyles, hereditary problems, aging, etc.Earlier detection of heart disease will help to save the life of individuals, by giving proper treatment thereby leading a better life. 
Thus, the earlier detection is necessary. This project proposed a machine learning approach to predict heart disease by using the attributes such as age, chol, fbs etc by applying suitable machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, logistic regression etc. and their efficiency is evaluated to find the best predictor model.
